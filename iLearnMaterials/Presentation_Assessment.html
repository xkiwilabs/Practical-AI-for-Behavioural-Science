<p>Each student will deliver one 3-minute presentation on a research paper that uses machine learning, AI, or computational methods in psychological or
    cognitive science research.</p>

<h3>Paper Selection</h3>
<p>Choose <strong>one research paper</strong> that meets at least one of these criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Uses a method covered in this course (regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, embeddings, etc.)</li>
    <li>Applies ML/AI methods to psychological or cognitive science research questions</li>
    <li>Discusses the use of LLMs or AI tools in research workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper does <strong>not</strong> need to match the topic of the week you present. You may choose any relevant paper that interests you.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This paper will also be the basis for your written assignment (popular science article). Choose a paper you find genuinely
    interesting, as you will be working with it throughout the semester.</p>

<h4>Example Methods (not exhaustive)</h4>
<p>Below are some ML and AI methods commonly used in psychological and cognitive science research. You are <strong>not limited to this list</strong> — any ML/AI
    method applied to psychology or cognitive science is welcome. If you're unsure whether your chosen paper is suitable, just check with me.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supervised learning:</strong> Linear/logistic regression, ridge/lasso regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, support
        vector machines</li>
    <li><strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong> K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, factor analysis, UMAP, t-SNE</li>
    <li><strong>Neural networks &amp; deep learning:</strong> Multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
        transformers, autoencoders</li>
    <li><strong>Natural language processing:</strong> Word embeddings, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, text classification, large language models (LLMs)</li>
    <li><strong>Computer vision:</strong> Face recognition, emotion detection, eye-tracking analysis, neuroimaging analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong> Computational models of learning and decision-making</li>
    <li><strong>Other approaches:</strong> Bayesian modelling, network analysis, agent-based modelling, simulation studies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Presentation Format</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 minutes (strictly enforced)</li>
    <li><strong>Slides:</strong> Maximum 1 HTML slide built with <a href="https://revealjs.com" target="_blank">reveal.js</a>. You can use <strong>any AI tools you like</strong> to create it — browser-based chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude), VS Code with Copilot, or any other AI assistant. Most chatbots can generate a complete HTML file for you right in the conversation. A starter template and step-by-step guide are in the course repository under <code>resources/</code>, but they're optional — design your slide however you like.</li>
    <li><strong>Gen-AI use:</strong> At the end of your presentation, you will be given 30 seconds to explain what LLM/chatbot/Gen-AI tools you used to research and prepare your presentation. Save your chat histories so you can refer back to them and discuss your process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Content Requirements</h3>
<p>Your presentation should cover:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Research question:</strong> What were the authors trying to understand or predict?</li>
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> What ML/AI technique(s) did they use? Briefly explain the approach.</li>
    <li><strong>Key findings:</strong> What did they discover? How well did it work?</li>
    <li><strong>One limitation or critique:</strong> What is one weakness, concern, or open question about this work?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Presentations occur during Challenge-Lab weeks (Weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10)</li>
    <li>8 to 10 presentations per class</li>
    <li>You will be assigned a presentation week by the beginning of Week 2</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>There are two things to submit:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>HTML file for presenting:</strong> Upload your HTML file to the shared OneDrive folder (link provided below) <strong>before</strong> your presentation session. This is how your slide will be opened on the classroom computer. File naming: <code>Firstname_Lastname.html</code></li>
    <li><strong>PDF for grading:</strong> Export your slide as a PDF and upload it to the iLearn submission portal <strong>before</strong> your presentation session. File naming: <code>Lastname_Firstname_Presentation.pdf</code></li>
</ol>

<h3><br>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Practice timing.</strong> 3 minutes goes fast. Rehearse to ensure you cover all four elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your slide minimal.</strong> Use it to support your talk, not replace it. Avoid walls of text.</li>
    <li><strong>Explain methods simply.</strong> Assume your audience understands basic concepts but not the specific paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Be critical, not dismissive.</strong> A good critique shows you understood the work deeply enough to identify its limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare for questions.</strong> Think about what classmates might ask and have brief answers ready.</li>
</ul>
