<h2>Unit Readings</h2>
<p>Each week, students are encouraged to read the suggested and optional readings. The suggested readings for each week will be listed on iLearn and identified during the lecture. These readings will cover and extend material noted in the lectures. Optional readings will also be listed in lecture slides. Optional readings are included for students who may be interested in reading more about the topics covered and material presented in lecture. These optional readings are also provided to help students identify research papers for the presentation and written assignment.</p>

<h2>Technology Needs</h2>

<h3>Laptop</h3>
<p><strong>Bring a laptop to class if you have one.</strong> During lab weeks, you will work in small groups on coding challenges. If you don't have a laptop, you can share with your group members — at least one laptop per group is required.</p>

<h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong> with Jupyter Notebooks for coding challenges</li>
    <li><strong>VS Code</strong> as your code editor: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">code.visualstudio.com</a> (free)</li>
    <li><strong>An LLM assistant</strong> (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar) for coding help and the written assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed setup instructions will be provided on iLearn before Week 2. Part of the Week 2 class will be dedicated to troubleshooting any setup issues, but please attempt the installation beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>All software used in this course is free</strong> or has free access for students.</p>

<h3>LLM Access</h3>
<p>You will use LLM assistants throughout this course for coding help, debugging, and the written assignment. All of these have free tiers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> <a href="https://chat.openai.com">chat.openai.com</a></li>
    <li><strong>Claude:</strong> <a href="https://claude.ai">claude.ai</a></li>
    <li><strong>Gemini:</strong> <a href="https://gemini.google.com">gemini.google.com</a></li>
    <li><strong>GitHub Copilot:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">github.com/features/copilot</a> (free for students)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> You must be able to copy or export your chat history for the written assignment.</p>

<h3>GitHub Account</h3>
<p>Sign up for a free GitHub account using your MQ email address at <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>. Then apply for the free GitHub Student Developer Pack at <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">education.github.com/pack</a> — this gives you access to GitHub Copilot and other useful tools for free.</p>

<h3>General Technology Requirements</h3>
<p>Computers and access to the Internet are essential for participating in this course. You must use them to access content saved on iLearn and complete online activities and assessments.</p>
<p>Technical difficulties are not grounds for special consideration, and in most cases, extensions to deadlines will not be granted. If you want to avoid losing any unnecessary marks, you should take responsibility for your computing. You must factor in potential computer and Internet problems when aiming to meet a deadline. This means regularly saving backup copies of your work and submitting early to allow for unforeseen issues arising.</p>
<p>If you have planned accordingly and problems arise, you can complete your assessments online using a computer in one of Macquarie University's many computing labs. As such, technical problems are not grounds for special consideration for any assessment task.</p>
<p>If you encounter problems while being diligent, complete the steps outlined below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Take a screenshot of any error message or similar message that comes up on the screen. You must show evidence that something went wrong.</li>
    <li>Contact technical support:
        <ul>
            <li>For iLearn problems, put in a OneHelp ticket request by emailing: <a href="mailto:ilearn.help@mq.edu.au">ilearn.help@mq.edu.au</a>, including the screenshot of the error message as an attachment and outlining what went wrong.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If technical support does not resolve the issue, email the Convenor and include your correspondence with the relevant technical support teams.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Course Datasets</h2>
<p>Datasets for all labs and challenges will be provided on iLearn. You do not need to find your own data for the group challenges.</p>

<h2>For the Written Assignment</h2>
<p>You will need to find a research paper that uses ML/AI methods in psychological or cognitive science research. Good places to search:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">PubMed</a> (for clinical/health psychology)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/psycinfo">PsycINFO</a> (via library)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org">Semantic Scholar</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use your LLM assistant to help find relevant papers, but verify that the papers actually exist and say what the LLM claims.</p>

<h2>Email Use</h2>
<p>It is University policy that the university-issued email account will be used for official University communication. All students are required to access their University account frequently. Only contact Macquarie University staff (including tutors) using your official MQ student's account because this is one method used to verify your identity.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discussion forum:</strong> Post questions on iLearn — help each other</li>
    <li><strong>Office hours:</strong> TBD</li>
    <li><strong>LLM assistants:</strong> Often faster than waiting for human help for coding problems — try them first, but verify their answers</li>
</ul>
