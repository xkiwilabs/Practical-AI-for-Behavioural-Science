<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This unit introduces modern computational methods now shaping psychological and cognitive science research, with a focus on machine learning and contemporary AI tools, including large language models (LLMs). Students learn how to frame research questions for supervised and unsupervised learning, evaluate models responsibly, and use LLM-based assistants to support coding, analysis, visualisation, and research workflows.</p>
<p><strong>No technical or mathematical background is assumed.</strong> Emphasis is placed on practical, student-guided experimentation and sound scientific interpretation. Students will learn to use modern LLM tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot) as coding assistants and problem-solving partners throughout the course.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Frame research questions</strong> appropriately for supervised and unsupervised machine learning</li>
    <li><strong>Build and evaluate</strong> regression, classification, clustering, and simple neural network models</li>
    <li><strong>Use LLM coding assistants</strong> effectively to write, debug, refactor, and document code</li>
    <li><strong>Interpret model outputs</strong> with appropriate uncertainty and connect findings to psychological constructs</li>
    <li><strong>Identify common pitfalls</strong> including overfitting, data leakage, and spurious structure</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate findings</strong> clearly, distinguishing prediction from explanation and acknowledging limitations</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate ethical implications</strong> of ML-based categorisation and prediction in psychological research</li>
</ol>

<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>The course alternates between:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lecture weeks</strong> (Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13): Introduce concepts, methods, and critical evaluation frameworks</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge-Lab weeks</strong> (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11): Hands-on group challenges using LLM-assisted coding, plus student paper presentations (Weeks 4, 6, 8, 10)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The LLM Problem-Solving Loop</h3>
<p>A core skill developed throughout this course is the ability to work effectively with LLM assistants. Students will practice this cycle:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>PLAN</strong> — What am I trying to do? What do I need?</li>
    <li><strong>PROMPT</strong> — Ask the LLM agent or coding assistant to help develop and test the code. Provide the LLM with the information and context it needs to be effective.</li>
    <li><strong>VERIFY</strong> — Is the approach valid? Does it run? Is the output sensible? Check shapes, plots, edge cases</li>
    <li><strong>REFINE</strong> — Fix errors, improve code, re-prompt if needed</li>
    <li><strong>DOCUMENT</strong> — Record what you did and why</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Critical rule:</strong> Never trust LLM output without verification.</p>
