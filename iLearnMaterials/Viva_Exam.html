    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Regression (linear, regularised)</li>
            <li>Classification (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)</li>

            <li>Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE)</li>
            <li>Neural networks</li>
            <li>Embeddings and text analysis</li>
            <li>LLM-assisted research workflows</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><strong><em>Time:</em></strong> Maximum of 2 minutes for the elevator pitch.</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><strong><em>Preparation:</em></strong> You may prepare this pitch in advance of the exam, but you cannot use any visual or written aids during your presentation.</div><br>
    <div><strong><em>Grading Criteria</em></strong></div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Clarity and Conciseness (30%) Ability to articulate the research proposal clearly, with main points easily understandable and presented within the allotted time</li>
            <li>Appropriateness and Technical Accuracy (30%) Demonstrating accurate understanding and application of ML/AI methods within the proposed study</li>
            <li>Innovation (40%) Originality and creativity in the research idea, including how the chosen methods are applied to explore new areas or offer fresh perspectives in psychological research</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><strong><em>Section 3b: LLM Reflection</em></strong></div>
    <div>Immediately following your elevator pitch (30 seconds)</div>
    <div>Briefly describe:</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>How you used LLM assistance to develop your research proposal</li>
            <li>What you verified, changed, or rejected from the LLM's suggestions</li>
            <li>How you made the proposal your own</li>
