# Written Assignment: Popular Science Article with LLM Collaboration

**Weight:** 40% · **Due:** Sunday 19 April 2026, 11:55pm · **Length:** Maximum 1400 words

---

## Overview

Write a popular science article (maximum 1400 words) about research that uses machine learning or AI in psychological or cognitive science. This assignment is designed to develop your skills in science communication *and* in working effectively with LLM assistants.

---

## The Core Requirement: Transparent LLM Collaboration

**You are required to use an LLM assistant** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) throughout this assignment — for literature searching, summarising papers, drafting, editing, and refining.

**However,** you must also demonstrate that you:

- Critically evaluated everything the LLM produced
- Verified facts, claims, and citations independently
- Made deliberate choices about what to keep, change, or reject
- Transformed the collaboration into work that is genuinely yours

**You will submit your complete chat history** alongside your article. This is not optional — it is a core part of the assessment.

## Article Requirements

### Topic

Your article should be based on **the same paper you used for your presentation**, but you may also:

- Reference other related research in the field
- Discuss broader applications of the ML/AI method
- Connect to other work using similar techniques

### Content

Write for an intelligent general audience (e.g., a science-curious friend or a journalist). Your article should:

- Explain what the researchers were investigating and why it matters
- Describe the ML/AI method in accessible terms (no jargon without explanation)
- Present the key findings and what they mean
- Discuss limitations, open questions, or ethical considerations
- Be engaging — this is popular science, not an academic paper

### Format

- **Length:** Maximum 1400 words (excluding references and chat history)
- **Style:** Engaging, accessible, suitable for a general audience
- **References:** Cite your main paper and any additional sources in APA format
- **Optional:** You may include one figure or image (with proper attribution)

---

## Chat History Requirements

Submit the **complete, unedited chat history** from your LLM interactions for this assignment. This should include:

- Literature searching and paper discovery
- Summarising and understanding papers
- Drafting sections of the article
- Editing and refining language
- Any fact-checking or verification conversations

### What We're Looking For in Your Chat History

Your chat history should demonstrate:

- **Planning and problem-solving:** You broke the task into steps, asked targeted questions, refined your approach
- **Critical evaluation:** You questioned LLM outputs, asked for clarification, pushed back on unclear claims
- **Verification:** You checked facts, confirmed citations exist, validated key claims independently
- **Iteration:** You refined drafts through multiple rounds, not just copy-paste of the first output
- **Ownership:** Your voice and judgements shaped the final product — the LLM assisted, you authored

### What Will Not Earn Credit

- Copying and pasting LLM output with minimal modification
- Accepting claims without verification
- Single-prompt generation of entire sections
- No evidence of critical engagement or iteration
- Chat history that doesn't match the submitted article

---

## Submission

Submit **two files** via Turnitin:

**1. Your article:** `[Lastname]_[Firstname]_Article.docx`
- 12-point font (Times New Roman or Arial)
- Double-spaced
- Header with name and student ID on each page
- References in APA format at the end

**2. Your chat history:** `[Lastname]_[Firstname]_ChatHistory.pdf`
- Export your complete chat(s) as PDF
- Include all conversations used for this assignment
- Do not edit or selectively omit portions

## Assessment Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Excellent (85–100%) | Good (70–84%) | Satisfactory (50–69%) | Needs Improvement (<50%) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **LLM Process: Problem-Solving** | 10% | Chat shows clear strategy: task breakdown, targeted prompts, iterative refinement | Good structure with some strategic prompting | Basic use; prompts are vague or unfocused | No clear strategy; single prompts, no iteration |
| **LLM Process: Critical Evaluation** | 10% | Consistently questions outputs, asks for evidence, pushes back on unclear claims | Some critical engagement; accepts some outputs uncritically | Limited questioning; mostly accepts LLM output | No evidence of critical evaluation |
| **LLM Process: Verification** | 10% | Clear evidence of fact-checking; confirms citations, validates claims independently | Some verification evident; occasional gaps | Minimal verification; relies heavily on LLM accuracy | No verification; copy-paste approach |
| **LLM Process: Ownership** | 10% | Final article clearly reflects student voice and judgement; LLM was a tool, not the author | Mostly student voice; some sections feel generic | Uneven; parts feel like unmodified LLM output | Article reads like direct LLM output |
| **Article: Content & Accuracy** | 20% | Accurate, insightful explanation of research and methods; appropriate depth | Mostly accurate; minor gaps in explanation | Basic accuracy; some concepts unclear or oversimplified | Significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings |
| **Article: Engagement & Accessibility** | 20% | Compelling, clear writing for general audience; excellent flow | Clear and readable; occasional jargon or flat sections | Understandable but dry or inconsistent tone | Difficult to follow; too technical or poorly structured |
| **Article: Critical Perspective** | 15% | Thoughtful discussion of limitations, ethics, or open questions | Some critical perspective; could go deeper | Superficial mention of limitations | No critical perspective |
| **Formatting & Citations** | 5% | Perfect formatting; all citations correct in APA | Minor formatting issues; citations mostly correct | Several formatting errors; some citation problems | Major formatting issues; missing or incorrect citations |

## Academic Integrity

This assignment **requires** LLM use — that is not academic misconduct. What matters is:

- **Transparency:** Your chat history shows exactly how you used the LLM
- **Verification:** You confirmed that information is accurate
- **Ownership:** The final work reflects your understanding and voice

What constitutes misconduct:

- Submitting an edited chat history that hides your actual process
- Claiming work is yours when it's unmodified LLM output
- Fabricating a chat history
- Not submitting a chat history at all

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start early.** Good LLM collaboration takes iteration — you can't do this the night before.
2. **Use the LLM for what it's good at:** Finding papers, explaining concepts, suggesting structure, improving clarity.
3. **Verify everything:** LLMs hallucinate citations and get facts wrong. Check independently.
4. **Keep your voice:** Read LLM drafts aloud. If it doesn't sound like you, rewrite it.
5. **Document your thinking:** When you reject or modify LLM suggestions, note why in the chat.
6. **Think of the chat as showing your work:** Like showing calculations in maths, your chat shows your reasoning process.
