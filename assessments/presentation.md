# Paper Presentation

**Weight:** 20% · **Duration:** 3 minutes · **Slides:** 1 HTML slide (submitted as PDF)

---

## Overview

Each student will deliver one 3-minute presentation on a research paper that uses machine learning, AI, or computational methods in psychological or cognitive science research.

---

## Paper Selection

Choose **one research paper** that meets at least one of these criteria:

- Uses a method covered in this course (regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, embeddings, etc.)
- Applies ML/AI methods to psychological or cognitive science research questions
- Discusses the use of LLMs or AI tools in research workflows

The paper does **not** need to match the topic of the week you present. You may choose any relevant paper that interests you.

**Important:** This paper will also be the basis for your written assignment (popular science article). Choose a paper you find genuinely interesting, as you will be working with it throughout the semester.

### Example Methods (not exhaustive)

Below are some ML and AI methods commonly used in psychological and cognitive science research. You are **not limited to this list** — any ML/AI method applied to psychology or cognitive science is welcome. If you're unsure whether your chosen paper is suitable, just check with me.

- **Supervised learning:** Linear/logistic regression, ridge/lasso regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, support vector machines
- **Unsupervised learning:** K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, factor analysis, UMAP, t-SNE
- **Neural networks & deep learning:** Multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, autoencoders
- **Natural language processing:** Word embeddings, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, text classification, large language models (LLMs)
- **Computer vision:** Face recognition, emotion detection, eye-tracking analysis, neuroimaging analysis
- **Reinforcement learning:** Computational models of learning and decision-making
- **Other approaches:** Bayesian modelling, network analysis, agent-based modelling, simulation studies

## Presentation Format

- **Duration:** 3 minutes (strictly enforced)
- **Slides:** Maximum 1 HTML slide — build it using <a href="../resources/html-slides-guide.md">reveal.js with the help of an LLM coding assistant</a>. A <a href="../resources/presentation-template/">starter template</a> is provided, but you're free to design your slide however you like — different colours, layouts, styles. The template is just a starting point.
- **Submission:** Export your slide as a **PDF** and upload it to the iLearn submission portal **before** your presentation session. File naming: `[Lastname]_[Firstname]_Presentation.pdf`
- **AI disclosure:** At the end of your presentation, you will be given 30 seconds to explain what LLM/chatbot/Gen-AI tools you used to research and prepare your presentation.

## Content Requirements

Your presentation should cover:

1. **Research question:** What were the authors trying to understand or predict?
2. **Methods:** What ML/AI technique(s) did they use? Briefly explain the approach.
3. **Key findings:** What did they discover? How well did it work?
4. **One limitation or critique:** What is one weakness, concern, or open question about this work?

---

## Scheduling

- Presentations occur during lab weeks (Weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10)
- 8 to 10 presentations per class
- You will be assigned a presentation week by the beginning of Week 2

## Assessment Criteria

| Criterion | Description | Weight |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Research question | Clearly stated and contextualised | 20% |
| Methods explanation | Accurate, appropriate level of detail | 30% |
| Key findings | Main results communicated clearly | 20% |
| Limitation/critique | Thoughtful, substantive critique identified | 20% |
| Time management | Within 3 minutes, well-paced | 10% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

## Tips for Success

- **Practice timing.** 3 minutes goes fast. Rehearse to ensure you cover all four elements.
- **Keep your slide minimal.** Use it to support your talk, not replace it. Avoid walls of text.
- **Explain methods in plain language.** Assume your audience understands basic concepts but not the specific paper.
- **Be critical, not dismissive.** A good critique shows you understood the work deeply enough to identify its limits.
- **Prepare for questions.** Think about what classmates might ask and have brief answers ready.
- **Use your LLM assistant.** It can help you understand the paper, simplify explanations, and build your HTML slide. That's encouraged — just be transparent about it.

## Creating Your HTML Slide

Your presentation slide is an HTML file built with <a href="https://revealjs.com" target="_blank">reveal.js</a> — the same framework used for the course lecture slides. You'll use an LLM coding assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to help you build it.

**Getting started:**
1. Download or copy the <a href="../resources/presentation-template/">presentation template</a>
2. Open it in VS Code
3. Ask your LLM assistant to help you customise it with your content
4. Open it in your browser to preview
5. Export to PDF for submission (see the <a href="../resources/html-slides-guide.md">HTML slides guide</a> for instructions)

The template includes the Macquarie University theme, but you can change anything — colours, fonts, layout. It's a starting point, not a requirement.
