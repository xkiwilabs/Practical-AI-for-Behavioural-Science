# Viva Exam

**Weight:** 40% · **Duration:** 15 minutes · **Format:** Individual, in-person oral exam

---

## Overview

This is an in-person exam — no exceptions. The exam will be administered and graded by Prof. Richardson. It covers all material presented in Weeks 1 to 11 and is composed of three sections.

---

## Section 1: Concept Definitions

**Maximum 4 points per question · 10 questions = 40 points total**

You will be required to provide clear, concise one-sentence definitions for key concepts related to machine learning, AI, and LLM-assisted research methods covered in this class. Each student will be given 10 concepts, randomly selected from a pool of 40, to define.

**Time:** Maximum of 20 seconds to think about and provide an answer for each concept.

**Grading Criteria:**
- **Technical accuracy (75%):** The accuracy of the provided definition
- **Conciseness (25%):** How concise (1–2 sentences) and straightforward the definition is (weighted by technical accuracy)

---

## Section 2: Short Answer — Research Application Questions

**Maximum 12 points per question · 3 questions = 36 points total**

You will be presented with research scenarios or data analysis problems and asked to provide 1-minute responses about which ML/AI methods would be appropriate and how you would apply them. Questions will be limited to methods, techniques, and concepts addressed in class (Weeks 1–11).

**Time:** 30 seconds to contemplate and plan your answer, then maximum 1-minute response.

### Example Question Types

- "A researcher has survey data and wants to predict which students are at risk of dropping out. What approach would you recommend and why?"
- "You have response time data from 200 participants and want to see if there are distinct subgroups. What methods would you use and what would you be cautious about?"
- "A colleague shows you a classification model with 95% accuracy on their training data. What questions would you ask before trusting this result?"

**Grading Criteria:**
- **Clarity and conciseness (40%):** Ability to answer clearly and straightforwardly, with main points easily understandable and presented within the allotted time
- **Appropriateness and technical accuracy (60%):** Demonstrating accurate understanding and application of the methods covered in class

## Section 3: Study Proposal — 2-Minute Elevator Pitch

**24 points total**

You are required to present a research study proposal using one or more of the ML/AI methods discussed in class. You are free to choose the psychological phenomena being investigated (e.g., from any subfield of psychology such as perceptual, cognitive, social, clinical, health, etc.), but the proposed study must use one or more of the following methods covered in class:

- Regression (linear, regularised)
- Classification (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)
- Clustering (k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE)
- Neural networks
- Embeddings and text analysis
- LLM-assisted research workflows

**Time:** Maximum of 2 minutes for the elevator pitch.

**Preparation:** You may prepare this pitch in advance of the exam, but you cannot use any visual or written aids during your presentation.

**Grading Criteria:**
- **Clarity and conciseness (30%):** Ability to articulate the research proposal clearly, with main points easily understandable and presented within the allotted time
- **Appropriateness and technical accuracy (30%):** Demonstrating accurate understanding and application of ML/AI methods within the proposed study
- **Innovation (40%):** Originality and creativity in the research idea, including how the chosen methods are applied to explore new areas or offer fresh perspectives in psychological research

### Section 3b: LLM Reflection

Immediately following your elevator pitch (30 seconds), briefly describe:

- How you used LLM assistance to develop your research proposal
- What you verified, changed, or rejected from the LLM's suggestions
- How you made the proposal your own

This reflection is not separately graded but informs your Innovation score — effective, critical use of LLM tools demonstrates sophisticated engagement with course concepts.

## Preparation Advice

### For Concept Definitions

- Review key terms from each week's lecture
- Practise giving concise, accurate definitions aloud
- Focus on precision — one good sentence is better than rambling

### For Short Answer Questions

- Think about how methods connect to research problems
- Practise explaining **why** you would choose a method, not just **what** it is
- Be ready to discuss limitations and potential pitfalls

### For the Study Proposal

- Choose a research question that genuinely interests you
- Match methods to the question — don't force a method where it doesn't fit
- Practise delivering in under 2 minutes without notes
- Think about what could go wrong (shows critical understanding)
- Use an LLM to help develop and refine your idea, but make it yours
