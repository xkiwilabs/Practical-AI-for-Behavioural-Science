# Assessments

PSYC4411 has three assessment items. Each one builds on the skills you develop through lectures and lab challenges — working with ML/AI methods, communicating findings, and using LLM assistants effectively.

| Assessment | Weight | Format | Due |
|------------|--------|--------|-----|
| [Paper Presentation](presentation.md) | 20% | 3-min talk + 1 HTML slide (PDF submission) | Weeks 4, 6, 8, or 10 |
| [Written Assignment](written-assignment.md) | 40% | Popular science article + LLM chat history | Sunday 19 Apr, 11:55pm |
| [Viva Exam](viva-exam.md) | 40% | 15-min oral exam (3 sections) | Weeks 12–13 |

## Quick Links

- **[Paper Presentation](presentation.md)** — Choose a research paper that uses ML/AI in psychology, present it in 3 minutes with one HTML slide. Presentations happen during lab weeks.
- **[Written Assignment](written-assignment.md)** — Write a popular science article about your chosen paper, using an LLM assistant throughout. Submit the article *and* your complete chat history.
- **[Viva Exam](viva-exam.md)** — Individual 15-minute oral exam covering all course content (Weeks 1–11). Three sections: concept definitions, research application questions, and a study proposal elevator pitch.

## Key Principles

**LLM use is required, not optional.** You are expected to use AI tools throughout your assessments — for research, coding, drafting, and refining. What matters is *how* you use them: transparently, critically, and with verification.

**Same paper for presentation and written assignment.** Choose a paper you find genuinely interesting — you'll work with it throughout the semester.

**AI disclosure.** Include an AI disclosure statement with all submitted work. See the [AI Disclosure Template](../README.md#ai-disclosure-template) in the course overview.
