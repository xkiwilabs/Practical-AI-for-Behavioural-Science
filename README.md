# PSYC4411: Current Advances in Psychological Methods and Analyses (2026)

A companion repository for the PSYC4411 course at Macquarie University. This repo contains weekly companion readings, code examples, challenge lab briefs, starter notebooks, and datasets.

**No technical or mathematical background is assumed.** This course teaches you to use modern ML/AI tools — including LLM coding assistants — for psychological and cognitive science research.

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Before each lecture:** Optionally read the companion material for that week
2. **During lab weeks:** Open the challenge brief and starter notebook for your group work
3. **After labs:** Use the examples and readings to deepen your understanding

## Setup

See the [Getting Started guide](setup/getting-started.md) for instructions on installing Python, Jupyter, VS Code, and setting up your LLM assistant.

## The LLM Problem-Solving Loop

A core skill you'll develop in this course:

1. **PLAN** — What am I trying to do? What do I need?
2. **PROMPT** — Ask your LLM assistant for help. Give it the context it needs.
3. **VERIFY** — Does it run? Is the output sensible? Check shapes, plots, edge cases.
4. **REFINE** — Fix errors, improve code, re-prompt if needed.
5. **DOCUMENT** — Record what you did and why.

**Critical rule:** Never trust LLM output without verification.

## AI Disclosure

The content and materials for this course were designed and developed in collaboration with numerous AI tools, including [Claude](https://claude.ai), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com). All materials were reviewed, verified, and curated by the course instructor. This transparent use of AI in course development reflects the same approach we teach students throughout the unit — AI tools are powerful collaborators, but human judgement, verification, and critical evaluation remain essential.
