In this notebook, you'll explore a dataset about lifestyle factors and depression, and create a multi-panel visualisation using an LLM coding assistant.\n\n**In this lab, you'll complete Part 1 using this notebook, then try Part 2 using Python scripts.** See the [challenge brief (README.md)](README.md) for full details on both workflows.\n\n**Remember the LLM Problem-Solving Loop:**\n\n**Outer loop (your research process):** PLAN → EXECUTE → EVALUATE → DOCUMENT\n\n**Inner loop (working with the AI):** ENGINEER → PROMPT → VERIFY → REFINE\n\nThe inner loop will probably run 2–5 times for each piece of code. That's normal — even experienced developers iterate with AI tools.\n\n---"

   "source": "## Step 2: PLAN Your Visualisation\n\nThis is the **PLAN** step of the outer loop — and it's the most important one. Before your AI writes any code, ask it to write a plan.\n\n**Why plan first?** A written plan catches misunderstandings before code is written. It's much easier to say \"actually, let's swap panel 3 for a violin plot\" when you're looking at a plan than after the AI has produced 50 lines of code. Planning saves iteration cycles and produces better results.\n\n### What to do\n\n1. Open your AI assistant (Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)\n2. Ask it to create an analysis plan — here's a prompt you can adapt:\n\n> \"Based on the dataset I've loaded (columns: Age, Gender, Height_cm, Weight_kg, TV_hrs_week, VideoGames_hrs_week, Siblings, FB_Friends, SocialMedia_hrs_week, Sleep_hrs_night, Exercise_hrs_week, Depression), write an analysis plan for a 2×2 multi-panel scatter plot figure exploring lifestyle factors and depression. Write the plan as a numbered list in markdown — what goes in each panel, what relationships we're testing, and what visual features to include. Don't write any code yet.\"\n\n3. **Paste the AI's plan into the markdown cell below.** (Double-click the cell to edit it.)\n4. **Review the plan.** Does the approach make sense? Would the panels tell a coherent story? Are the variable choices interesting?\n5. **Revise if needed.** Go back to the AI and ask for changes — \"Actually, let's use Age instead of TV hours for the fourth panel\" — until you're happy with the plan.\n\nA good plan makes everything that follows faster. You'll write better prompts and spend less time debugging because you know exactly what you're aiming for."

   "source": "## Step 3: ENGINEER Your Prompt\n\nNow that you have a reviewed plan, your prompts will be much more focused. You know exactly what each panel should show, so you can give the AI precise instructions.\n\nThis is the most important skill you'll develop in this course: writing prompts that give the AI enough context to produce useful code.\n\n### Weak Prompt vs. Strong Prompt\n\nHere's the same request, written two different ways:\n\n---\n\n**Weak prompt:**\n> \"Make me a graph of my data\"\n\nThis will produce *something*, but probably not what you want. The AI has to guess what data you have, what type of graph you want, what variables to use, and what libraries are available. It will guess wrong on at least one of these.\n\n---\n\n**Strong prompt:**\n> \"I have a pandas DataFrame called `data` with 2000 rows. It has columns including `Sleep_hrs_night` (continuous, 4–9), `Exercise_hrs_week` (continuous, 0–7), `SocialMedia_hrs_week` (continuous, 0–50), `Age` (continuous, 18–65), and `Depression` (continuous, 0–10).\n>\n> Using matplotlib and seaborn, create a 2×2 figure (figsize 12×10) with:\n> - Top-left: scatter plot of Sleep vs Depression with a linear trend line\n> - Top-right: scatter plot of Exercise vs Depression with a linear trend line\n> - Bottom-left: scatter plot of Social Media vs Depression with a linear trend line\n> - Bottom-right: scatter plot of Age vs Depression with a quadratic trend line\n>\n> Use alpha=0.3 for the scatter points, add descriptive titles to each subplot, and use `sns.despine()` to clean up the borders. Add an overall figure title.\"\n\n---\n\nThe strong prompt tells the AI:\n- **What your data looks like** (column names, types, ranges)\n- **What libraries to use** (matplotlib and seaborn)\n- **Exactly what you want** (4 specific panels, each described)\n- **Visual details** (transparency, titles, styling)\n\nThis will almost certainly produce working, good-looking code on the first try. **The time you invest in writing a good prompt saves you time debugging bad code.**\n\nNow write your own prompt based on your plan from Step 2. Open your LLM assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot Chat, etc.) and send it."
