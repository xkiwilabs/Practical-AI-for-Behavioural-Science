# GitHub Guide for Beginners

GitHub is where the course materials live and where you'll access weekly readings, challenge briefs, starter notebooks, and datasets. This guide covers what you need to know.

## What Is GitHub?

GitHub is a website for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code and documents. Think of it as Google Drive for code — files are stored online, anyone with access can view them, and changes are tracked over time.

A **repository** (or "repo") is like a project folder. The PSYC4411 course repo contains all your weekly materials, organised into folders.

You don't need to learn the command-line tool `git` for this course. Everything you need can be done through the GitHub website and VS Code.

## Creating Your Account

1. Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>
2. Click **Sign up**
3. **Use your personal email** (not your MQ email) — your MQ email will expire after graduation, but your GitHub account will stay with you for your career
4. Choose a professional username — something like `jsmith-psych` rather than `party_animal_99`
5. Complete the signup process

## Key Concepts

- **Repository (repo):** A project folder on GitHub containing files, folders, and their history
- **Branch:** A parallel version of the repo. We use `main` for student-facing content. You won't need to create branches.
- **Commit:** A saved snapshot of changes. Each commit has a message describing what changed.
- **README.md:** The main information file in any folder. GitHub automatically displays it when you open a folder.
- **Fork:** Your own copy of someone else's repo. You won't need this for the course.

## Tips

- **Bookmark the course repo** in your browser for quick access
- **Check the repo before each class** for updated materials
- You don't need to learn git commands — browsing and downloading from the website is sufficient
- If you want to learn git (optional but useful), GitHub has an excellent <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World tutorial</a>
