# GitHub Student Verification — Macquarie University

GitHub sometimes rejects Macquarie University student IDs during the Student Developer Pack application because MQ IDs **do not show an expiry date**. If this has happened to you, don't worry — you can fix it by submitting a supporting enrolment verification letter alongside your ID.

## What You Need

1. **The verification letter template** — download it here: [Student_GitHub_Enrolment_Verification_Letter_Template.docx](Student_GitHub_Enrolment_Verification_Letter_Template.docx)
2. A clear photo or scan of the **front of your MQ student ID**
3. A clear photo or scan of the **back of your MQ student ID**
4. **Optional but recommended:** your **unofficial transcript** (especially if GitHub has already rejected your ID on its own)

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Fill in the letter template

Open the downloaded `.docx` file and fill in your details (name, student ID, degree/program, and date). Do not change the wording beyond adding your own details.

### 2. Prepare your supporting documents

Take clear, well-lit photos (or scans) of:

- The **front** of your MQ student ID
- The **back** of your MQ student ID

If you have an **unofficial transcript**, download it from eStudent. This is optional but can strengthen your application if your ID alone was already rejected.

### 3. Combine everything into a single PDF

Put the following into **one PDF document**, in this order:

1. Completed verification letter
2. Student ID (front)
3. Student ID (back)
4. Unofficial transcript (if included)

> **Important:** Submit this as **a single PDF file** — not multiple separate files or images. Verification systems handle a single document much more reliably.

**How to combine into one PDF:**

- **Mac:** Open all files in Preview, drag pages into one document, then save as PDF
- **Windows:** Use "Print to PDF" from Word or a free tool like <a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com/merge_pdf" target="_blank">iLovePDF</a>
- **Either platform:** Ask your LLM assistant "How do I combine images and a Word document into one PDF on [Mac/Windows]?" for step-by-step instructions

### 4. Check your PDF before submitting

Before you upload, make sure:

- Your **name is clearly visible** and matches across all documents
- The student ID photos are **readable** (no blur or glare)
- The transcript is **legible**
- The PDF **opens correctly**

### 5. Submit to GitHub

Go back to your <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">Student Developer Pack application</a> and upload the single PDF as your verification document.

## If Your Application Is Still Rejected

Bring the rejection message to class (or email me), and we can work out what additional evidence might be needed. GitHub support is generally responsive — sometimes it just takes a second attempt with clearer documentation.
