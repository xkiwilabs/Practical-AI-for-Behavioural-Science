# Week N Challenge Lab: [Challenge Title]

## The Challenge

[Clear, concise statement of what students need to accomplish. One paragraph max.]

## Background

[Brief context — what method/concept from the previous lecture is being applied here. 2-3 sentences.]

## Dataset

The data for this challenge is in the [`data/`](data/) folder.

[Description of the dataset: where it comes from, what each column/variable represents, how many observations, any important notes about missing data or coding.]

| Variable | Description | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `var1` | [description] | continuous |
| `var2` | [description] | categorical |

## Getting Started

### Suggested Approach

1. [Step 1 — e.g., "Load the data and check its shape"]
2. [Step 2 — e.g., "Visualise the key variables"]
3. [Step 3 — e.g., "Build a baseline model"]
4. [Step 4 — e.g., "Evaluate and iterate"]

### Useful LLM Prompts

Here are some prompts to try with your LLM assistant to get started:

- "[Example prompt 1 — framed as a question]"
- "[Example prompt 2 — framed as a question]"
- "[Example prompt 3 — framed as a question]"

### Starter Code

Open [`starter.ipynb`](starter.ipynb) for a scaffolded notebook with imports and data loading already set up.

## What to Present

Prepare **1 HTML slide** summarising your group's solution for the start of next week's lecture (~3 min per group). Build it using <a href="https://revealjs.com" target="_blank">reveal.js</a> with the help of any AI tool — a browser chatbot (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude), VS Code with Copilot, or anything else. A <a href="../../resources/presentation-template/">starter template</a> and <a href="../../resources/html-slides-guide.md">step-by-step guide</a> are provided, but you can design it however you like.

**File naming:** Save your file as `Group#_Week#.html` — where the first number is your group number and the second is the challenge lab week (e.g., `Group3_WeekN.html`). Upload it to the shared OneDrive folder (link in iLearn) before the start of next week's lecture so it can be opened on the classroom computer. No PDF needed for challenge lab presentations.

Your slide should include:
- Your approach (what did you try?)
- Key result (plot, metric, or finding)
- One thing that surprised you or didn't work as expected
