# Week N Challenge Lab: [Challenge Title]

## The Challenge

[Clear, concise statement of what students need to accomplish. One paragraph max.]

## Background

[Brief context — what method/concept from the previous lecture is being applied here. 2-3 sentences.]

## Dataset

The data for this challenge is in the [`data/`](data/) folder.

[Description of the dataset: where it comes from, what each column/variable represents, how many observations, any important notes about missing data or coding.]

| Variable | Description | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `var1` | [description] | continuous |
| `var2` | [description] | categorical |

## Getting Started

### Suggested Approach

1. [Step 1 — e.g., "Load the data and check its shape"]
2. [Step 2 — e.g., "Visualise the key variables"]
3. [Step 3 — e.g., "Build a baseline model"]
4. [Step 4 — e.g., "Evaluate and iterate"]

### Useful LLM Prompts

Here are some prompts to try with your LLM assistant to get started:

- "[Example prompt 1 — framed as a question]"
- "[Example prompt 2 — framed as a question]"
- "[Example prompt 3 — framed as a question]"

### Starter Code

Open [`starter.ipynb`](starter.ipynb) for a scaffolded notebook with imports and data loading already set up.

## What to Present

Prepare **1 HTML slide** summarising your group's solution for the start of next week's lecture (~2 min per group). Build it using [reveal.js with the help of an LLM coding assistant](../../resources/html-slides-guide.md) — a [starter template](../../resources/presentation-template/) is provided, but you can design it however you like. Export it as a **PDF** for submission.

Your slide should include:
- Your approach (what did you try?)
- Key result (plot, metric, or finding)
- One thing that surprised you or didn't work as expected
